Haxball bot for power HotSmall Challenge.

## Features
You can power headless game host for haxball with hotsmall map.

This works without any GUI dependencies. You can launch on console.

## How to Build
You need to install dependencies if you didn't.

You don't have to build again if you did it already.

```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
## How to Use
You need to prepare `headless token key`. You can get it from [here](https://www.haxball.com/headlesstoken).

If you got the token, you have to launch the application and input your room's configuration values.

Then, you can launch your own game room.

## How to Backup
You have to make and keep a copy of `.node-persist` directory to preserve important player data.

And you can also check the log in `.logs` directory. These data will be kept for 30 days.
